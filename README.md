# Project_Team_2

### Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the various coding languages we have learned over the course of the Bootcamp by using a dataset, building a machine learning model to provide a prediction, and visualizing the results for users.

### Selected Topic:
Predicting user income level based on the following features:

### Description of Data Source:
Our datasource comes from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification

The Data Source contains information on age, workclass, final weight (total number of people represented in row), education level, marital status, occupation, familial relationship, race, gender, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, and native country.

### Database Engine
Postgres - to be used for data cleaning

### Machine Learning Model(s)
We will using classification models. Our plan is to test a few different models to determine accuracy before deciding which will be used for our user interface. Our project will include live predictions.

### List of tables
Income_Table - contains the columns listed in the description of data source.
